# react-reddit-app 

Demo Live: https://limitless-reaches-38545.herokuapp.com

## Pre-requisites    
- node: 10.16.x    
- npm: 6.9.x    
- ts-node: v8.6.2
    
## Setup and start:
```
yarn && yarn start
``` 
That will start client on: `http://localhost:3000`    

 
## Run test:
```
yarn test
```  

## Environment variables 
You will need to define your own `.env` file. As a reference, you could check the existing `.env.example` on each app.

## Some design, patterns, principles and best practices followed

- In order to scale and build a more robust file structure, I choose to organize the code by features instead of by types. Also I follow a variation of the pattern called duck and re-duck conventions, for more info I wrote [here](https://medium.com/@jero786/duck-re-duck-183da6e5a35a) about it.
- I use selectors to get data from the store. Implementing selectors improve complex operations and also to lifting our state in a more granular way (help us to keep following SRP principle). Also we open a windows of improvements to implement reselect or other mechanism of memoization.
- I sticked to the following action type naming convention:
  ACTION: Effect is most commonly a noun that means the result of an action.
  ASYNC ACTION CREATOR: Affect is most commonly.
  For more information, I wrote [here](https://medium.com/@jero786/action-noun-verb-effect-is-most-commonly-a-noun-that-means-the-result-of-an-action-e3e00d662444) about it.
- To persist in the local state I use middleware, the patter Event But, it's really great pattern that allows us to add extra functionality to our application in a really seamless and transparent way.
- I follow strongly the SRP (Single responsibility principle). One reason to change. Each module/class/function has its own level of abstraction.
- I follow strongly separation of concern, about reducers, actions, view containers, dump components, selectors, etc.
- For nature, Redux must force to follow observer patterns, immutability, pure functions avoiding side-effect and becomes more deterministic.

## Testing tips

- Testing presentation layer (View and Controller): Following the Separation of presentation pattern, the idea of testing the view and controller is to test the view as much as dump as possible. The view, as an observer of the model like happens on MVC pattern, should be in charge of sending the proper messages to the model (actions).
    And then the model (the store) will notify their listeners (connected view) if there is some change to be notified in a unidirectional data flow way like it happen in an Observer Pattern.
- Also, when you are testing the View, we need to take care to don't test implementation detail UI. It will help us to avoid false positives (actually there is some bug, but your test don't prevent it) or false negatives (you are performing a refactor which change the way that you implement it, but it's still valid from the user point of view).
- Test should follow the SRP principle too (single responsibility principle). Do one thing, test one thing.
- Test files, should be ended with *.test.tx and should be placed in the same folder from their SUT (Subject under test).
- Keep in mind the implicit structure of test must be AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert).
- Each test must be isolated, means that one test not be dependent to another in order to get given result, therefore it should not matter the order of execution of them.
- Avoid global variables. Instead, declare them in setup method.
- Follow the DRY principle (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself). If we identify that we have repeated code throughout our tests use beforeEach function to put the code in one place.
- Putting comments in the header of the test is an anti-pattern, avoid them.

## Frameworks & libraries

- Typescript: Implementing check typing in a dynamic interpreted language like JS, help us and also to Ides, to catch typos and errors while your are coding. That is a really important when you app will be large.
- I choose to use testing-library instead of enzyme, in order to avoid testing implementation details. For more information, I wrote [this](https://medium.com/@jero786/write-test-not-too-many-mostly-integration-bad298f69e1a) article about it.
- Redux: The reactive programming allow us to build more predictable, scalable & Solid web application.
- I implement the lib `reduxjs/toolkit` because it helps you to remove a lot of boilerplate code from Redux. Also implement shared structure, allowing us to perform shallow equality and avoid unheeded rendering.
- Lodash: For cross browsing support, performance and reliable way to handler data. (only for dump component and action creators).
- Prettier/husky/lint-staged/Eslint, Help us to avoid commit and push some code that don't follow with the default standards of the project and also prevent to push some code that don't pass the UT. (It's already configure airbnb, and eslint:recommended practices)
- Style-component: it allow us to jump one level of abstraction, but we gain as a property a really optimization about which CSS we use or not and also we don't care any more about css global collisions.
